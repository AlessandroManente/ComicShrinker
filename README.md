# ComicShrinker

This project aims to build a utility which should be used to reduce space occupied by comics on your drives.

## Objectives

- [ ] Completely open source (though tied to Delphi for my convenience)
- [ ] Cross-platform
- [ ] Multithreaded
- [ ] To define client/server or monolithic architecture
- [ ] Program capabilities:
  - [ ] Recompress .cbz files regardless of whether the content is .jpg or .png (evaluate other formats)
  - [ ] User-requested recompression level
  - [ ] Recursive recompression
  - [ ] In-place or in a separate folder recompression
  - [ ] Estimate of the final size
  - [ ] Potentially use the method employed by everything
